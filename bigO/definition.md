BigO: A way to describe how well an algorithm performs as its input sizes grow
"how code slows as data grows"

BigO:  describes how an algorithm's run time or space requirements grow as the input size grows.

BigO: The amount of time it takes for an algortithm to execute as the input size grows.


Time complexity
Space complexity

O(1) = constant time

O(log n) = logarithmic time

O(n) = linear time

O(n^2) = quadratic time
